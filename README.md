# Predictive Modelling for Rental Property Prices

The development of a data-driven model for predicting residential property rental prices has several potential applications:

Real Estate Agencies and Property Management Companies: Real estate agencies and property management companies can use such a model to provide accurate rental price estimates to property owners and landlords. This helps in setting competitive rental rates and maximizing rental income.

Online Rental Platforms: Online rental platforms such as Airbnb, Zillow, or Realtor.com can integrate this model to provide users with estimated rental prices for properties listed on their platforms. It enhances user experience by providing valuable information for both renters and property owners.

Property Investors and Developers: Property investors and developers can utilize the model to assess the potential rental income of residential properties before making investment decisions. It assists in identifying lucrative investment opportunities and optimizing portfolio management.

Tenants and Renters: Prospective tenants and renters can leverage the model to estimate rental prices before negotiating with landlords or property managers. It enables informed decision-making and helps renters budget effectively.

Government and Urban Planning Authorities: Government agencies and urban planning authorities can use the model to analyze rental price trends and patterns in different neighborhoods or cities. This information can inform housing policies, urban development plans, and affordable housing initiatives.

Financial Institutions: Banks and financial institutions may employ the model as part of their risk assessment process for mortgage loans or property investments. Accurate rental price predictions contribute to better risk management and loan underwriting.

Academic Research: Researchers studying housing markets, real estate economics, or predictive modeling can utilize the model for empirical studies and analysis. It provides insights into factors influencing rental prices and can contribute to academic literature in the field.

Insurance Companies: Insurance companies may incorporate rental price predictions into their risk assessment models for property insurance policies. Accurate rental price estimates help in determining appropriate coverage and premiums.
